    "> This Arts Data Profile gives national and state-level estimates of artists in the workforce. The figures derive from American Community Survey (ACS) data covering 2015-2019. The ACS is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. State-level estimates are available for the total number of artists and for each individual type of artist (workers in any of 13 specific artist occupations).\n",

An LQ of 0.8 indicates that the state's labor force in an occupation is 20 percent below the occupation's national labor force share. |\n",
